# What is a cloud and what is cloud computing?
Some interviewers choose to start the discussion with fundamental questions that are meant to assess the applicant's basic understanding of cloud computing. The best way to answer this question is usually to give a brief definition and explanation of the terms.

## Example: 
“A cloud is a system of networks, services, storage devices, hardware and interface that work together to deliver computer as a service to its users. Its three users can be end-users, business management users and cloud service providers. Cloud computing as an advanced way of using cloud services, as it gives users a way to access several worldwide servers and access various services from anywhere around the globe.”

# What do you think are the main benefits of cloud computing?
This is also a basic question and you should provide a straightforward answer that briefly mentions the most important advantages of using cloud computing.

## Example: 
“The main benefit of cloud computing is that it allows users to freely and easily backup and store large amounts of data on powerful and secure servers. This is usually much more cost-effective than storing data locally, therefore, improving productivity.”

# Can you say a few words about the different cloud service models?
One of the most often encountered interview questions for cloud engineers is asking them to describe the three predominant models of cloud service. It's usually best to provide brief descriptions that outline the main characteristics of each cloud service model, without getting into very advanced details and concepts. If the interviewer then wants you to elaborate on an aspect, they are likely to specifically ask for it.

## Example: 
“There are three main cloud service models:

Infrastructure as a Service (Compute Engine, EC2, etc): This allows users to access various hardware resources without needing to purchase and install them. It's highly scalable, mainly due to it being highly automated, meaning that it offers each user exactly the resources they need.

Platform as a Service(App engine, etc): It is a way to manage and customize applications that require cloud components. It is especially helpful in situations where multiple developers work on the same project, allowing each to contribute separately toward a common goal.

Software as a Service(Google Kubernetes Engine, etc): This is a service model that implies various apps being made available to the end-user via cloud platforms and subscriptions. They are usually very convenient to use, as they don't require additional installations and run on multiple devices from any location with an internet connection."
